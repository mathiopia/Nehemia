# Nehemia
This is just to show you all that what kind of thing we are trying to create in Nehemia

## first of all I'm not a good coder.
 i just want to show what I learned while reading trigonometry
 ## Trigonometry is very interesting topic if you dive in 
 - it relates complex numbers
 - exponetial growth
 - circles
 - triangles
 - pythagores ðŸ˜ƒ
 - hyperbolas ðŸ™€  Its a huge branch of mathematics
## I just showed a peice of it


*the most intersting thing i found while doing this animation is that showing the derivative of one is the other and I found it accidentaly swithing values*
